# Project PaintingLight

PaintingLight is a project conducted by the Style2Paints team, aimed at finding a method to manipulate the illumination in digital paintings. The project started at about 2019 January, and the core algorithm is accepted by ACM Transitions on Graphics at 2020. 

Because digital painting illumination data is not easy to obtain, this algorithm does not use deep learning. The core idea is to make use of color geometry to build up a perceptually workable relighting system. Such effect may not be physically accurate, but are good enough for artistic use cases.

Note that the project is still in its technical researching stage. If you are a digital painting artist and you accidentally find this page, you may have to wait for us releasing our ongoing PhotoShop plug-in for practical usage.
